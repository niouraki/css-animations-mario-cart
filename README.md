#Mario Cart Animation
This repository follows the tutorial CSS Animation Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgw82b5Y2MU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iGYgmEd2dm3zAKzyCGDtM5

I added some things for extra practice and to make the project more personal.

1. The sky gets animated as time goes by. It looks like night and day change.
2. I added a sun and it goes up and down as time changes.
